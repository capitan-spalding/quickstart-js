## Goal: Systematically, incrementally, safely, and verifiably upgrade the `firebase-admin` dependency in `@firestore/functions` to its latest stable version.  

## Guidance
Come up with an exhaustive detailed plan to accomplish this goal. The plan should be a thorough checklist of tasks to accomplish the goal. This file will be used as a workspace to track progress towards that goal.

## Upgrade Plan for `firebase-admin`

This plan outlines the steps to safely upgrade the `firebase-admin` dependency incrementally, major version by major version.

### Phase 1: Preparation and Assessment

- [ ] **1.1. Understand Current State:**
    - [ ] 1.1.1. Identify current `firebase-admin` version: Check `package.json` for the exact version.
    - [ ] 1.1.2. Review `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: Note other dependencies that might be related or affected.
    - [ ] 1.1.3. Examine existing code: Understand how `firebase-admin` is currently used in `src/index.ts` and other relevant files.

- [ ] **1.2. Backup Project:**
    - [ ] 1.2.1. Ensure the current project state is committed to version control (e.g., `git commit -am "Pre-upgrade backup"`).
    - [ ] 1.2.2. (Optional but recommended) Create a separate branch for the upgrade (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/upgrade-firebase-admin`).

### Phase 2: Incremental Upgrade Loop

This phase will be repeated for each major version upgrade until the latest stable version is reached.

- [ ] **2.1. Identify Next Major Version:**
    - [ ] 2.1.1. Determine the *next immediate major version* of `firebase-admin` from the current installed version (e.g., if current is 9.x.x, next is 10.x.x).
    - [ ] 2.1.2. If the current version is already the latest stable, proceed to Phase 3.

- [ ] **2.2. Research Breaking Changes & Migration Guides for Current Jump:**
    - [ ] 2.2.1. Consult the official `firebase-admin` changelog/release notes (e.g., GitHub releases, Firebase documentation) for all versions *between the current and the identified next major version*.
    - [ ] 2.2.2. Pay close attention to any breaking changes, deprecations, or required migration steps. Document these in the 'Migration Notes' section below.

- [ ] **2.3. Install Target `firebase-admin` Version:**
    - [ ] 2.3.1. Run `npm install firebase-admin@<next-major-version>` (e.g., `npm install firebase-admin@10`).
    - [ ] 2.3.2. Review `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to confirm the update.

- [ ] **2.4. Update Related Dependencies (if necessary):**
    - [ ] 2.4.1. Based on research in 2.2, update any other dependencies that are required or recommended for compatibility with the new `firebase-admin` version (e.g., `firebase-functions`, TypeScript).
    - [ ] 2.4.2. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are correctly resolved.

- [ ] **2.5. Code Modifications:**
    - [ ] 2.5.1. Apply all necessary code changes identified in Phase 2.2 (e.g., API changes, new initialization patterns, updated types).
    - [ ] 2.5.2. Address any TypeScript compilation errors (`tsc`) that arise from the upgrade.

- [ ] **2.6. Run Build/Transpilation:**
    - [ ] 2.6.1. Execute the project's build command (e.g., `npm run build` or `tsc`) to ensure there are no compilation errors.

- [ ] **2.7. Manual Testing / Local Emulation:**
    - [ ] 2.7.1. If applicable, run the Firebase Functions locally using the Firebase Emulator Suite (`firebase emulators:start`).
    - [ ] 2.7.2. Manually test key functionalities that rely on `firebase-admin` (e.g., Firestore operations, authentication, messaging).

- [ ] **2.8. Commit Incremental Changes:**
    - [ ] 2.8.1. Commit the changes with a clear and descriptive commit message (e.g., `feat: Upgrade firebase-admin to vX.Y.Z`). This creates a stable checkpoint before the next major version jump.

- [ ] **2.9. Repeat:** Go back to step 2.1 until the latest stable version is reached.

### Phase 3: Finalization

- [ ] **3.1. Review and Refine:**
    - [ ] 3.1.1. Review all changes made to the code across all incremental steps.
    - [ ] 3.1.2. Ensure all temporary changes or debug statements are removed.

## Migration Notes

This section will be populated with specific breaking changes and migration steps identified for each major version jump.

- **From X.x.x to Y.x.x:**
    - [ ] Note 1
    - [ ] Note 2

- **From Y.x.x to Z.x.x:**
    - [ ] Note 1
    - [ ] Note 2

This checklist will be updated as progress is made.
